notes,,,,,,,,
"viewbox: Being a vertically focused diagram, we are mainly concerned with calculating y values.  The diagram uses an svg/inkscape viewbox to establish a coordinate system. Ie. X = -200 to +200 and Y= 0 to 1000 downwards",,,,,,,,
Most of the vertical positoning and sizing of objects are from derived y values - ie. Relationships with other objects in the diagram.,,,,,,,,
The only two application user input/output values required by this diagram are 'Observer Height (h1)' and 'Target height'. ,,,,,,,,
"14. The C_Point_Line, is an important reference line which represents the line of sight from the observer A, touching the horizon at B and onward to C where C crosses an extended radius line that passes through the center of the object/structure (eg. mountain).  ",,,,,,,,
"18.  Mountain... we need to calculate the base of the mountain's y coordinate (X) from the 14, the C_Point_Line.  We have this measurement via the XC calculated field but we might want to consider a new calcualted field representing the perspective adjusted measurement - because XC is leaning away from the observer due to Earth's curvature",,,,,,,,
18. Mountain… we need to calculate the top of the mountain (Z) and we can do this with the 'Target Height' user input.  ,,,,,,,,
"18. Mountain… As the 'Target Height' is optional, the application can hide this diagram if Target Height is not input",,,,,,,,
"18. Mountain… If there is a proportion of the mountain object that is 'visible' as opposed to being 'hidden' below/beyond the horizon, the diagram uses layers and opacity to visualse the visible vs hidden parts of the mountain. 17. Beyond_Horizon_Hidden is a rectangle with a fill opacity that allows the 'hidden' part of the mountain to be seen.  However, the visible portion of the mountain is above the semi-opaque rectangle and therefore appears darker.  ",,,,,,,,
