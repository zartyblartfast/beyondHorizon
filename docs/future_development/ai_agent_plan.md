# BeyondHorizon Evolution Plan

## Phase 1: API Development (2-3 weeks)
1. **Create Separate API Repository**
   - New repository: `beyondHorizonAPI`
   - Extract core calculation logic
   - Add location validation endpoints
   - Implement elevation data integration

2. **Deploy API Service**
   ```
   Initial Platform: Azure Functions (Free Tier)
   Endpoints:
   - /calculate (core calculations)
   - /validate (location verification)
   - /elevation (height data)
   - /distance (point-to-point)
   ```

3. **Add External Services**
   - Google Elevation API
   - OpenStreetMap Geocoding
   - Weather API integration

## Phase 2: Basic Bot Development (2-3 weeks)
1. **Create Bot Repository**
   ```
   Repository: beyondHorizonBot
   Stack:
   - Node.js/Python
   - Twitter API v2
   - Basic scheduling
   ```

2. **Implement Core Bot Features**
   - Daily preset posts
   - Basic query responses
   - Simple location validation

3. **Deploy Bot Service**
   ```
   Platform: Railway.app
   Features:
   - Automated posting
   - Basic interaction
   - Error logging
   ```

## Phase 3: AI Integration (3-4 weeks)
1. **Add AI Capabilities**
   ```python
   Components:
   - LangChain/AutoGen framework
   - GPT-4 integration
   - Conversation memory
   - Reasoning engine
   ```

2. **Implement Verification Logic**
   ```
   Verification Steps:
   1. Location validation
   2. Elevation confirmation
   3. Distance calculation
   4. Weather/atmospheric analysis
   5. Physical possibility check
   ```

3. **Add Dispute Resolution**
   ```
   Resolution Process:
   1. Claim analysis
   2. Mathematical verification
   3. Evidence collection
   4. Clear explanation
   5. Reference citation
   ```

## Phase 4: Integration & Advanced Features (4-5 weeks)
1. **Preset Management System**
   ```
   Features:
   - Automated verification
   - GitHub PR creation
   - Human review interface
   - Version control
   ```

2. **Evidence Collection**
   ```
   Sources:
   - Weather records
   - Photography metadata
   - Elevation databases
   - Scientific papers
   - User reports
   ```

3. **Advanced Interaction**
   ```
   Capabilities:
   - Multi-turn conversations
   - Image analysis
   - Data visualization
   - Educational content
   ```

## Example Bot Interactions

1. **Verification Request**:
```
User: @BeyondHorizonBot Can you see NYC from Philadelphia?

Bot: Let me analyze this claim! üî≠

Analysis:
1. Philadelphia elevation: ~12m
2. NYC tallest building: 541m (1WTC)
3. Distance: 97km
4. Earth curvature effect: 582m

Conclusion: ‚ùå Not possible from ground level
- Even with perfect conditions (k=1.25):
  - Hidden by curve: 437m
  - 1WTC would be ~104m below horizon
  
Would you like details about:
1. Minimum height needed?
2. Best viewing locations?
3. Similar verified views?
```

2. **New Preset Verification**:
```
Bot: üîç Analyzing reported view: Mount Baker from Victoria, BC

Verification Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Locations confirmed
2. ‚úÖ Elevations verified
   - Observer: 23m
   - Target: 3286m
3. ‚úÖ Distance: 140.3km
4. ‚úÖ Mathematical possibility
5. ‚úÖ Weather conditions analyzed
6. ‚úÖ Photographic evidence found

Conclusion: ‚úÖ Verified! Creating preset...
